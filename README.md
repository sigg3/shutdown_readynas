# shutdown_readynas
Small utility to shutdown a Netgear ReadyNAS using browser automation.
This is rather overkill, but works over HTTPS yay!

Usage: ./shutdown_readynas &lt;IP> &lt;PASSWORD>

# TODO
0. Ping NAS first (connection issues)
1. Test that we're actually on the login page (error handling)
